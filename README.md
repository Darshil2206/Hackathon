## 📍 Overview
*AI-SmartPark* is a predictive solution designed for the smart city of Gandhinagar. By analyzing historical occupancy and real-time traffic trends, it eliminates the "search time" for drivers, reducing city congestion and carbon footprints.

### 🌟 Key Highlights
* *AI Confidence:* Provides a % likelihood of finding a spot (not just a Yes/No).
* *Zone-Wise Mapping:* Interactive map covering Sector 21, Infocity, and more.
* *Sustainability Driven:* Focused on reducing fuel wastage and urban idling.

---

## 🏗️ The 6-Step Methodology
1.  *Problem ID:* Solving the "30% traffic surge" caused by parking searches.
2.  *Data Sync:* Merging historical occupancy with local event calendars.
3.  *Feature Tuning:* Identifying demand spikes (e.g., peak office hours in Gandhinagar).
4.  *AI Engine:* Powered by *Random Forest Regressors* for non-linear prediction.
5.  *Inference Layer:* Real-time processing for instant user updates.
6.  *Scalability:* API-first design ready for integration with existing city apps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Frontend* | React.js, Tailwind CSS |
| *Backend* | Python (FastAPI / Flask) |
| *AI/ML Engine* | Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas |
| *Mapping* | Leaflet.js / OpenStreetMap |

---

## 📊 Predictive Logic
The AI calculates availability using:
$$Availability\_Score = f(Time, Location, Traffic, Events)$$

* *Green:* High Availability (> 70%)
* *Yellow:* Moderate/Filling Fast (30% - 70%)
* *Red:* Nearly Full (< 30%)
